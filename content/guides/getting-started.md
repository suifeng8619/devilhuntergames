# Complete Devil Hunter Beginner's Guide

**Critical:** This guide helps you avoid permanent mistakes that thousands of Devil Hunter players regret. Read carefully before making irreversible decisions.

## The Path System: Your Most Important Choice

The path you choose in Devil Hunter is **PERMANENT** and defines your entire playstyle. Choose wisely.

### Human Path

**Maximum Flexibility**

- ✅ **3 Contract Slots**: Switch between contracts freely
- ✅ **Adapt to Any Situation**: Counter any opponent
- ✅ **Best for Beginners**: Learn mechanics without commitment
- ❌ **No Permanent Buffs**: Lower stat ceiling
- ❌ **Skill Dependent**: Requires good decision-making

**Best For:** PvP versatility, contract experimentation, learning the game

**Recommended If:** You're new to Devil Hunter or enjoy adapting your playstyle

### Fiend Path

**Consistent Power**

- ✅ **4-5 Talent Slots**: Permanent stat boosts
- ✅ **Stable Builds**: Always perform consistently
- ✅ **PvE Farming**: Efficient and reliable
- ❌ **No Contracts**: Cannot use any contracts
- ❌ **Less Flexible**: Harder to adapt to situations

**Best For:** PvE farming, stable builds, passive playstyle

**Recommended If:** You prefer consistency and farming over PvP flexibility

### Hybrid Path

**High Risk, High Reward**

- ✅ **Transformation Mode**: Powerful burst windows
- ✅ **Unique Abilities**: Abilities no other path has
- ✅ **1 Contract + 1 Talent**: Hybrid benefits
- ❌ **5% Drop Rate**: 20+ hours to obtain form
- ❌ **Permanent Choice**: Cannot switch forms
- ❌ **High Skill Cap**: Requires mechanical mastery

**Best For:** Endgame min-maxing, dedicated players

**⚠️ WARNING:** Do NOT choose Hybrid until level 50+. Most players regret early Hybrid commitment.

## Devil Hunter Contract Acquisition

Understanding how to get contracts efficiently saves you hours of grinding. Contracts are obtained through 4 main categories:

### Category 1: Floor Zero Contracts

Floor Zero is a wave-based survival mode. Several contracts require playing this mode:

| Contract | How to Obtain | Difficulty |
|----------|--------------|------------|
| Cursed Devil | Clear any wave in Floor Zero | Easy |
| Zombie Devil | Kill the Zombie after Wave 7 | Medium |
| Bat Devil | Kill the Bat spawn in Floor Zero | Easy |

**Tip:** Floor Zero can be done solo or in party. Party is faster but solo gives full credit.

### Category 2: Raid Boss Contracts

Raid bosses drop specific contracts. Some require party play:

| Contract | How to Obtain | Solo/Party |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Control Devil | Kill Control Boss | Both |
| Bomb Devil | Kill Bomb Boss | Party Required |
| Katana Devil | Use Blood Manipulation + Kill Katana Boss | Both |
| Violence Devil | Defeat Violence Boss | Party Required |
| War Devil | Deal 30%+ damage to War Boss | Party Required |

**Tip:** Join Discord to find raid parties. Party raids are 40% faster.

### Category 3: Free Roam Contracts

These contracts have special conditions in the open world:

| Contract | How to Obtain | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Fox Devil | Free from NPC Natsuki | Tutorial reward |
| Mantis Devil | Pass combat trial (<10% damage taken, >70% damage dealt) | Hard skill check |
| Angel Devil | Use Lifespan from Blood Gauge | Requires Blood Gauge unlocked |
| Punishment Devil | Use Lifespan + Get 3 kills + Win match | Complex requirements |
| Chainsaw Devil | SACRIFICE Blood Manipulation | **PERMANENT LOSS** |
| Future Devil | SACRIFICE Eyes | **PERMANENT - Unlocks Vision** |

**⚠️ WARNING:** Chainsaw Devil and Future Devil require PERMANENT sacrifices. Read the Permanent Mistakes guide before committing.

### Category 4: Shrine & NPC Contracts

| Contract | How to Obtain | Cost |
|----------|--------------|------|
| Ghost Devil | Training Room Shrine | 50 Favor |

**Favor System:** Favor is earned through gameplay. Losing matches can reduce Favor - be careful in PvP if saving for Ghost Devil.

### Quick Contract Tier List

**S-Tier (Best):**
- Future Devil (PvP meta, requires sacrifice)
- Chainsaw Devil (Highest damage, requires sacrifice)
- Violence Devil (Best PvE)

**A-Tier (Great):**
- Ghost Devil (Strong utility)
- Control Devil (Good crowd control)
- War Devil (High burst)

**B-Tier (Solid):**
- Fox Devil (Free starter)
- Mantis Devil (Skill-based)
- Angel Devil (Unique playstyle)

## Resource Management Strategy

### Yen (Currency) - CRITICAL Priority

1. **Redeem ALL codes immediately** (275K free Yen)
2. **Never gamble at Contract Dealer** (0% return on investment)
3. **Save 150K for Black Market S-tier purchase**
4. **Farm PvE for consistent income** (15K-30K/day)

### Contracts - High Priority

1. **Get Fox Devil on Day 1** (free B-tier from tutorial)
2. **Prioritize Future Devil or Ghost Devil** for PvP
3. **Violence Devil is best PvE starter**
4. **Don't acquire contracts you won't use** (Yen waste)

### Time - Medium Priority

1. **Complete daily missions** (30 mins, highest priority)
2. **Focus on progression** over exploration
3. **Join group raids** for efficiency (40% faster)
4. **Don't grind Hybrid forms until 50+** (inefficient at low levels)

## Day 1 Checklist

**Follow this exact order to avoid permanent mistakes:**

### Step 1: Redeem Codes (5 minutes)

- ✅ Check `/quick-start` for current active codes
- ✅ Redeem all codes IMMEDIATELY (they expire)
- ✅ You should have ~275K Yen after redemption

### Step 2: Choose Your Path (Think carefully!)

- ✅ Read path descriptions above
- ✅ Consider your playstyle preference
- ✅ **Recommendation:** Choose Human if unsure

**⚠️ WARNING:** This decision is PERMANENT. Take your time.

### Step 3: Get Fox Devil (10 minutes)

- ✅ Complete tutorial fully
- ✅ Talk to ALL NPCs in starting area
- ✅ Claim free Fox Devil contract (B-tier)
- ✅ This is the ONLY free contract

### Step 4: Plan Your First S-Tier Purchase

**If you chose Human path:**

- **Option A (PvP):** Save for Future Devil (150K)
- **Option B (PvP Stealth):** Save for Ghost Devil (150K)
- **Option C (PvE):** Save for Violence Devil (120K)

**If you chose Fiend path:**

- Focus on getting B-tier talents first
- Save Yen for talent upgrades

**If you chose Hybrid path:**

- **STOP.** You should NOT choose Hybrid on Day 1.
- Read the warning section in our [Permanent Mistakes Guide](/guides/permanent-mistakes)

### Step 5: Start Daily Mission Routine

- ✅ Learn where daily mission board is located
- ✅ Complete at least 3 missions before logging off
- ✅ Build the habit early (15K Yen/day)

## Common Beginner Questions

### "Should I gamble at Contract Dealer?"

**NO.** Never. The math doesn't work:

- Average cost for S-tier: 11 spins × 3K = 33K Yen
- Black Market guaranteed: 150K Yen
- With codes (275K), you can afford 1-2 S-tier contracts guaranteed

Gambling is for players who don't know the math. Don't be one of them.

### "Can I switch paths later?"

**NO.** Path choice is permanent. The only way to change is resetting your entire account and losing all progress.

18% of players have reset their accounts due to wrong path choice. Don't join them.

### "What if I mess up my build?"

**Human path:** Contracts are flexible - you can change them anytime. No permanent mistakes.

**Fiend path:** Talent choices are harder to change. Research talents before committing.

**Hybrid path:** You're locked into your form choice forever. Research thoroughly before grinding.

### "When should I start PvP?"

Wait until you have:

1. At least 1 S-tier contract (if Human)
2. Level 30+ with basic mechanics mastery
3. Understanding of popular contract matchups

Jumping into PvP too early just leads to frustration.

### "Is Hybrid path really that hard to get?"

Yes. Statistics:

- **Average time:** 20 hours of raid grinding
- **Drop rate:** 5% per raid clear
- **Fastest recorded:** 3 raids (extremely lucky)
- **Slowest recorded:** 127 raids (1% of players)

Do NOT attempt Hybrid grinding until level 50+ with optimized builds.
