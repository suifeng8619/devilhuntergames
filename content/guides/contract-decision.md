# Devil Hunter Contract Decision Guide

**Purpose:** Help you choose the RIGHT contracts for YOUR playstyle, not what's "meta"

**Important:** This guide assumes you've chosen Human path. Fiend players should focus on talents instead.

---

## The Decision Tree

Answer these questions honestly to find your perfect contract match.

### Question 1: What's your primary gamemode?

**A) Mostly PvP (70%+ of playtime)**
→ Go to [PvP Contract Selection](#pvp-contract-selection)

**B) Mostly PvE / Farming (70%+ of playtime)**
→ Go to [PvE Contract Selection](#pve-contract-selection)

**C) Balanced 50/50 PvP and PvE**
→ Go to [Hybrid Contract Selection](#hybrid-contract-selection)

---

## PvP Contract Selection

You said you mainly do PvP. Let's find your playstyle.

### Question 2A: How do you prefer to win fights?

**Option 1: Outsmart opponents with prediction/strategy**
→ Your first S-tier: [**Future Devil**](/database/contracts/future-devil)

**Why Future Devil:**
- S+ tier PvP (95% win rate in skilled hands)
- Predict opponent moves 2 seconds ahead
- Perfect for strategic players
- High skill ceiling rewards practice

**Backup options:**
- [Control Devil](/database/contracts/control-devil) (crowd control)
- [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (support utility)

---

**Option 2: Burst damage / Assassination playstyle**
→ Your first S-tier: [**Ghost Devil**](/database/contracts/ghost-devil)

**Why Ghost Devil:**
- S tier stealth burst
- Invisible approach, guaranteed surprise
- One-shot potential on squishies
- Feels satisfying to outplay

**Backup options:**
- [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (frontline burst)
- [Curse Devil](/database/contracts/curse-devil) (DoT burst)

---

**Option 3: Sustain / Bruiser playstyle**
→ Your first S-tier: [**Violence Devil**](/database/contracts/violence-devil)

**Why Violence Devil:**
- S tier bruiser
- Lifesteal = tanky DPS
- Forgiving mistakes (sustain heals you)
- Good in both PvP and PvE

**Backup options:**
- [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (healing support)
- [Fox Devil](/database/contracts/fox-devil) (beginner-friendly)

---

### Question 2B: Do you have high APM (actions per minute)?

**Yes, I'm mechanically skilled:**
→ **Future + Ghost combo** (S+ tier, requires skill)

**No, I prefer simpler execution:**
→ **Violence + Angel combo** (S tier, forgiving)

---

### PvP Contract Priority List

**Your first 150K Yen should buy:**

1. **Future Devil** (if strategic player) OR
2. **Ghost Devil** (if assassin player) OR
3. **Violence Devil** (if bruiser player)

**Your second 150K Yen should buy:**

- **Complement your first contract** for synergy
- Future → add Ghost (prediction + stealth)
- Ghost → add Future (stealth + prediction)
- Violence → add Angel (sustain + healing)

**Your third contract (optional):**

- **Counter-meta pick** to handle specific matchups
- Struggling vs tanks? Get Curse Devil
- Struggling vs burst? Get Control Devil
- Want versatility? Get Fox Devil

---

## PvE Contract Selection

You said you mainly farm PvE. Let's optimize efficiency.

### Question 2A: What's your farming goal?

**Option 1: Maximum damage / Fast clears**
→ Your first S-tier: [**Violence Devil**](/database/contracts/violence-devil)

**Why Violence Devil:**
- S tier PvE (best DPS contract)
- Lifesteal = no downtime
- Scales with missing HP (risk/reward)
- 40% faster raid clears

**Backup options:**
- [Curse Devil](/database/contracts/curse-devil) (DoT for bosses)
- [Ghost Devil](/database/contracts/ghost-devil) (burst single-target)

---

**Option 2: Survivability / Solo content**
→ Your first S-tier: [**Angel Devil**](/database/contracts/angel-devil)

**Why Angel Devil:**
- S tier support
- Healing = never die
- Good for solo challenging content
- Enables riskier strategies

**Backup options:**
- [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (lifesteal tank)
- [Fox Devil](/database/contracts/fox-devil) (balanced starter)

---

**Option 3: Group content / Raids**
→ Your first S-tier: **Depends on role preference**

**Tank Role:**
- [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (lifesteal tank, S tier)

**DPS Role:**
- [Ghost Devil](/database/contracts/ghost-devil) (burst, S tier)
- [Curse Devil](/database/contracts/curse-devil) (DoT, A tier)

**Support Role:**
- [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (healer, S tier)
- [Control Devil](/database/contracts/control-devil) (CC, A tier)

---

### PvE Contract Priority List

**Your first 150K Yen should buy:**

- **Violence Devil** (universal PvE king, works in 90% of situations)

**Your second 150K Yen should buy:**

- **Angel Devil** (adds survivability for harder content)

**Your third contract (optional):**

- **Curse Devil** (specialized boss killer for raids with high HP)

**PvE 3-Contract Optimal Setup:**

```
Slot 1: Violence Devil (main DPS)
Slot 2: Angel Devil (survivability)
Slot 3: Curse Devil (boss specialist)
```

**This covers:** Fast farming, solo content, group raids, boss fights

---

## Hybrid Contract Selection

You play both PvP and PvE equally. Let's find versatile contracts.

### Question 2: What's more important?

**Option A: Excel at PvP, decent at PvE**
→ Prioritize PvP contracts with PvE utility

**Recommended:**
1. First S-tier: [Future Devil](/database/contracts/future-devil) (S+ PvP, A PvE)
2. Second: [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (S PvP, S PvE)
3. Third: [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (A PvP, S PvE)

**Why this works:**
- Future Devil dominates PvP
- Violence Devil carries PvE
- Angel Devil fills gaps

---

**Option B: Excel at PvE, decent at PvP**
→ Prioritize PvE contracts with PvP utility

**Recommended:**
1. First S-tier: [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (S PvP, S PvE)
2. Second: [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (A PvP, S PvE)
3. Third: [Ghost Devil](/database/contracts/ghost-devil) (S PvP, A PvE)

**Why this works:**
- Violence Devil works everywhere
- Angel Devil enables harder PvE
- Ghost Devil adds PvP burst option

---

**Option C: Be good at both, not best at either**
→ Go for maximum flexibility

**Recommended:**
1. First S-tier: [Violence Devil](/database/contracts/violence-devil) (S tier both)
2. Second: [Future Devil](/database/contracts/future-devil) (S+ PvP, A PvE)
3. Third: [Angel Devil](/database/contracts/angel-devil) (A PvP, S PvE)

**Why this works:**
- Violence is universally strong
- Future adds PvP dominance
- Angel ensures you never die in PvE

---

## Budget-Conscious Decisions

### "I only have 150K Yen (no codes). What do I buy?"

**Best value for 150K:**

**Option 1: Violence Devil** (Safest pick)
- Works in both PvP and PvE
- Forgiving playstyle (lifesteal)
- Good at all levels
- Can carry you to endgame

**Option 2: Future Devil** (High risk, high reward)
- Dominates PvP if you're skilled
- Weaker in PvE
- High skill requirement
- Can be frustrating while learning

**Our recommendation:** Violence Devil for first S-tier

### "I'm F2P. Should I save for 2 S-tiers or get 1 now?"

**Get 1 S-tier now. Here's why:**

**Math:**
- 1 S-tier at Week 1: You start strong, earn Yen faster, reach 2nd S-tier by Week 3
- Waiting for 2 S-tiers at Week 2: You're weak longer, slower Yen, reach 2nd S-tier by Week 4

**Power spike timing matters.** Getting your first S-tier ASAP accelerates everything else.

---

## Special Case: Fox Devil (Free Starter)

### "Should I keep using Fox Devil?"

**Fox Devil is B-tier. Replace it when you get S-tier.**

**Fox Devil good until:**
- Level 30 (can carry you this far)
- You acquire first S-tier contract
- You enter competitive PvP

**When to stop using Fox Devil:**
- You have 2+ S-tier contracts → bench Fox
- You're level 40+ → Fox falls off
- You're losing PvP due to contracts → upgrade

**Don't feel bad about replacing Fox:** It served its purpose (free B-tier to get you started).

## Contract Synergy Matrix

These contracts work well together:

### S+ Tier Synergies

| Primary | Secondary | Rating | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Future | Ghost | S+ | Prediction + Stealth = Guaranteed Kill |
| Violence | Angel | S | Lifesteal + Healing = Unkillable |
| Ghost | Control | A+ | Stealth + CC = Team Wipe Setup |

### Good Synergies

| Primary | Secondary | Rating | Why It Works |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Future | Violence | A | Prediction + Sustain = Duelist |
| Curse | Control | A | DoT + Disable = Anti-Tank |
| Fox | Angel | B+ | Beginner + Support = Safe Learning |

### Anti-Synergies (Don't Use Together)

| Contract 1 | Contract 2 | Why Not |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Ghost | Angel | Stealth + Support = Role confusion |
| Violence | Curse | Both want damage dealing, no utility |
| Fox | Any S-tier | Fox is redundant with S-tier |

## Common Decision Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Copying Meta Blindly

**What players do:**
- "Top player uses Future Devil, so I will too"
- Ignore their own playstyle
- Struggle because it doesn't fit them

**Why this fails:**
- Future Devil requires high skill
- If you're not strategic, it's wasted
- Meta contracts still need skill to use

**Do this instead:**
- Match contract to YOUR playstyle
- B-tier contract you master > S-tier contract you suck at

---

### Mistake #2: Collecting All Contracts

**What players do:**
- "I want to try every contract"
- Buy 5-6 different contracts
- Master none of them

**Why this fails:**
- Contracts require practice to master
- Spreading Yen = weak in everything
- Better to master 2-3 than own 6

**Do this instead:**
- Pick 2-3 core contracts
- Master them fully
- Add variety AFTER mastery

---

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Synergy

**What players do:**
- Buy contracts individually without plan
- "This one looks cool"
- End up with anti-synergy combos

**Why this fails:**
- Contracts work better together
- Ghost + Angel = role confusion
- Wasted potential

**Do this instead:**
- Plan your 3-contract loadout
- Check synergy matrix above
- Buy contracts that complement each other

---

## FAQ

### "What if I choose wrong and regret it?"

**Good news:** Contracts are swappable (you're Human).

**If you regret a contract:**
1. You can bench it (swap to different contract)
2. You're only out 150K Yen (recover in 2 weeks)
3. Lesson learned (now you know your playstyle better)

**Bad news:** You can't refund contracts

**Prevention:** Read this guide before buying, test in custom matches if possible

### "Should I save for one specific contract or buy whatever's available?"

**Save for specific contract. Here's why:**

**Scenario A (Buy whatever):**
- Week 1: Buy random A-tier (100K)
- Week 2: Have 140K, can't afford S-tier yet
- Week 3: Finally afford S-tier, but wasted 100K

**Scenario B (Save for specific):**
- Week 1: Save (70K)
- Week 2: Save (140K)
- Week 3: Buy desired S-tier (210K - 150K = 60K left)

**Patience saves money.** Don't buy B-tiers unless you specifically need them.

### "How do I know if I'm 'strategic' vs 'mechanical' player?"

**Strategic Players:**
- Enjoy planning 3 moves ahead
- Prefer outsmarting to outplaying
- Good at predicting opponents
- Patient playstyle
→ Choose Future Devil

**Mechanical Players:**
- Enjoy fast-paced action
- Prefer outplaying to planning
- Good at combos and execution
- Aggressive playstyle
→ Choose Ghost or Violence Devil

**Not sure?** Default to Violence Devil (works for both)

---

## Final Recommendations

### For Absolute Beginners (Level 1-30)

**Use Fox Devil (free)** until you can afford S-tier

**Don't buy anything** until you have 150K saved

**First purchase:** Violence Devil (universal, forgiving)

### For Intermediate Players (Level 30-50)

**You should own:** 1-2 S-tier contracts

**Focus on:** Mastering current contracts before buying more

**Next purchase:** Synergy contract for your main

### For Advanced Players (Level 50+)

**You should own:** 2-3 S-tier contracts forming a cohesive build

**Focus on:** Refining combos, learning matchups

**Next purchase:** Counter-meta or experimental contracts

## Take Action

**Your Next Steps:**

1. ☐ Identify your primary gamemode (PvP / PvE / Balanced)
2. ☐ Identify your playstyle (Strategic / Mechanical / Sustain)
3. ☐ Follow the flowchart to find your perfect contract
4. ☐ Check if you have enough Yen (need 150K for S-tier)
5. ☐ If not enough, follow [Yen Farming Guide](/guides/yen-farming)
6. ☐ Buy your first S-tier contract
7. ☐ Practice for 20+ matches before buying second contract

**Remember:** Right contract for wrong player < Wrong contract for right player

It's not about "best" contract. It's about YOUR best contract.
