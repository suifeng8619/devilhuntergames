# Devil Hunter Yen Farming Guide

**Goal:** Earn 70K+ Yen per day consistently without gambling

**Target Audience:** All players level 20+

---

## The Optimal Daily Routine

**Total Time:** ~2 hours
**Total Yen:** 70K+
**Consistency:** 100% (no RNG)

### Routine Breakdown

```
Daily Missions (30 mins) → 15K Yen
Bat Devil Raid x3 (45 mins) → 30K Yen
PvP Wins x5 (30 mins) → 25K Yen
─────────────────────────────────
TOTAL: ~2 hours → 70K Yen
```

**Why this works:**
- No gambling (consistent income)
- Time-efficient (35K Yen/hour)
- Sustainable (can do daily)
- All tasks have skill-based success

---

## Income Source #1: Daily Missions (CRITICAL)

**Income:** 15K Yen
**Time:** 30 minutes
**Priority:** HIGHEST (always do this first)

### Why Daily Missions Matter

- **Time-gated:** Resets every 24 hours
- **Guaranteed:** No RNG, 100% success rate
- **Essential:** Missing one day = -15K Yen
- **Accumulates:** Miss 10 days = -150K (that's an S-tier contract)

**Rule:** NEVER skip daily missions. Log in even on busy days.

### Daily Mission Types

**1. Combat Missions (5-10 mins)**
- "Defeat 20 enemies in any mode"
- "Win 3 PvE battles"
- "Complete 1 raid"

**2. Social Missions (2-5 mins)**
- "Join a group raid"
- "Add 1 friend"
- "Send 3 emotes"

**3. Collection Missions (5-10 mins)**
- "Collect 10 resources"
- "Open 5 chests"
- "Talk to 3 NPCs"

**4. Time Investment Missions (10-15 mins)**
- "Play for 15 minutes"
- "Complete 2 contracts worth of activities"
- "Reach X location"

### Optimization Strategy

**The 30-Minute Clear:**

1. **Log in:** Check mission board (0 mins)
2. **Quick missions:** Social + Collection first (10 mins)
3. **Combat bundle:** Do combat missions during PvE farming (15 mins)
4. **Time investment:** Auto-completes while doing other activities (5 mins)

**Pro tip:** Do combat missions WHILE farming raids. Double efficiency.

### What If You Miss a Day?

**Impact Analysis:**

- Miss 1 day: -15K Yen (recoverable)
- Miss 3 days: -45K Yen (sets you back 2 days)
- Miss 7 days: -105K Yen (major setback)
- Miss 14 days: -210K Yen (that's 6 days of full routine)

**If you missed multiple days:**
1. Don't panic
2. Start fresh today
3. Focus on consistency from now on
4. You'll catch up in 2-3 days of full routine

**Remember:** Yesterday's losses are gone. Today is Day 1.

## Income Source #2: Bat Devil Raid Farming

**Income:** 30K Yen (3 runs × 10K each)
**Time:** 45 minutes
**Priority:** HIGH

### Why Bat Devil Raid?

**Compared to other raids:**

| Raid | Yen/Run | Time/Run | Yen/Hour | Difficulty |
|------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Bat Devil | 10K | 15 mins | 40K | Medium |
| Spider Devil | 12K | 25 mins | 28.8K | Hard |
| Control Devil | 15K | 35 mins | 25.7K | Very Hard |

**Bat Devil wins on Yen/hour efficiency** (even though drop is smaller).

### Optimal Bat Raid Strategy

**Solo Clear (15 mins):**

**Phase 1: Entry (2 mins)**
- Use Violence Devil or Fox Devil
- Clear entry mobs efficiently
- Don't waste abilities on trash

**Phase 2: Boss Fight (10 mins)**
- Dodge sonic scream (one-shot kill)
- Attack during wing cooldown
- Save burst for 30% HP (enrage phase)

**Phase 3: Exit (3 mins)**
- Collect loot (10K Yen + drops)
- Reset for next run

**Group Clear (8 mins):**

- 40% faster with competent group
- Coordinate burst damage
- Share Yen split (still 10K each)

### Daily Run Limits

**Bat Devil has 3 FREE runs per day:**
- Run #1: 10K Yen
- Run #2: 10K Yen
- Run #3: 10K Yen
- Run #4+: Requires 5K Yen entry fee (not worth it)

**Math:** After 3 runs, you're paying to play. Stop at 3.

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Running raids beyond 3 free runs:** You're spending Yen to earn Yen
❌ **Choosing harder raids for "better drops":** Time efficiency matters more
❌ **Solo when undergeared:** Join groups if clear time >20 mins

✅ **Do this instead:** 3 Bat runs, use saved time for PvP Yen

---

## Income Source #3: PvP Wins

**Income:** 25K Yen (5 wins × 5K each)
**Time:** 30 minutes (assuming 60% win rate)
**Priority:** MEDIUM (can be skipped if time-limited)

### Why PvP for Yen?

**Benefits:**
- Good Yen/hour (50K/hour if you win fast)
- Improves PvP skills
- Counts towards rank climb
- No entry fees

**Drawbacks:**
- Win-dependent (lose = no Yen)
- Tilt risk (affects other activities)
- Skill-gated (new players struggle)

### Win Rate Optimization

**If your win rate is:**

- **70%+:** PvP is your best Yen source (prioritize this)
- **50-70%:** PvP is decent (do after raids)
- **30-50%:** PvP is break-even (skip if you don't enjoy)
- **<30%:** Focus on PvE until you improve

**Reality check:** Most players have 50% win rate by definition (matchmaking).

### Fast Win Strategies

**Goal:** 6-8 minute matches

**#1: Use Meta Contracts**
- Future Devil or Ghost Devil
- Win faster with better tools

**#2: Aggressive Playstyle**
- End fights quickly (win or lose fast)
- Don't play for draw

**#3: Target Weaker Opponents**
- If you notice an opponent struggle, capitalize
- Not BM, just efficient

**#4: Surrender Lost Matches**
- If you're down 70% HP at 2 mins, surrender
- Save 4 mins, queue next match
- 5 fast losses < 1 slow win in time spent

### The Mental Game

**Tilt Management:**

After 2 losses in a row:
1. Take 5-minute break
2. Do 1 Bat raid clear (refresh mindset)
3. Return to PvP with clear head

**Why this works:**
- Tilt loses more games
- Break prevents tilt spiral
- Raid clear = guaranteed Yen + confidence boost

**Mindset:** You need 5 wins, not a winstreak. Losses are fine.

## Income Source #4: Code Redemption (One-Time)

**Income:** 275K Yen (one-time bonus)
**Time:** 5 minutes
**Priority:** CRITICAL (do immediately)

### Current Active Codes (January 2026)

Visit [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) for always-updated code list.

**Why codes matter:**
- Equivalent to 18 days of daily routine
- Enough for 1-2 S-tier contracts
- Time-limited (expire in 3-7 days)

**If you already redeemed codes:**
- Check back monthly for new codes
- Game updates often include new codes
- Join Discord #codes channel for instant notifications

---

## Advanced Yen Maximization

### Contract Flip Trading (Expert - Not Recommended for Beginners)

**Strategy:**
- Buy low-tier contracts from Dealer when discounted
- Resell to Black Market for 30% profit

**Why this is risky:**
- Requires 50K+ Yen capital
- Market prices fluctuate
- Can lose money on bad timing

**Only attempt if:**
- You have 200K+ Yen buffer
- You understand market cycles
- You're willing to lose 10K learning

**Most players should skip this.** The effort-to-reward ratio isn't worth it.

### Time-Gated Content Priority

**When you have limited time, prioritize in this order:**

1. **Daily Missions** (15K, 30 mins) ← NEVER SKIP
2. **Bat Raid x3** (30K, 45 mins) ← High value
3. **PvP Wins x5** (25K, 30 mins) ← If you enjoy/good at PvP
4. **Story Progression** (variable) ← Only after dailies
5. **Exploration** (0 Yen) ← Lowest priority for Yen farming

**Logic:** Time-gated = highest priority. Can't make it up later.

## Weekly Yen Goals

### Week 1 (with Codes)

**Target:** 350K Yen

- Codes: 275K
- Daily Routine x7: 70K × 7 = 490K
- **Total:** 765K

**Spending Plan:**
- S-tier Contract #1: 150K
- S-tier Contract #2: 150K
- Emergency Fund: 200K
- Upgrades: 265K

### Week 2+ (without Codes)

- Daily Routine x7: 70K × 7 = 490K

**Weekly Budget:**
- Raid Entry Fees: 0 (using free runs)
- Upgrades: 50K
- Savings: 440K

**At this rate:**
- 1 S-tier contract every 4 days

## Common Yen Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Gambling at Contract Dealer

**What players think:**
- "I'll get lucky this time"
- "Just one more spin"
- "The S-tier is coming"

**What actually happens:**
- Average cost: 33K for S-tier
- 25% spend 50K+ before success
- Some spend 100K+ (worst case)

**Math doesn't lie:**
- Contract Dealer expected value: -3K Yen per spin
- You're paying 3K for a 27% chance
- Over time, you ALWAYS lose

**Never gamble. Ever.** Save for guaranteed Black Market.

### Mistake #2: Buying Low-Tier Contracts

**What players do:**
- Buy B-tier contracts (50K each)
- "Need contracts for my build"
- End up with 3 B-tiers and no S-tier

**Why this is wrong:**
- B-tier contracts are weak endgame
- 50K × 3 = 150K (that's 1 S-tier)
- You're delaying your power spike

**Correct priority:**
1. Get 1 S-tier first
2. Then consider B-tiers for synergy
3. Never buy C-tier (use Fox Devil instead)

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Group Raids

**What players do:**
- Solo raid: 15 mins per clear
- 3 raids = 45 mins total
- Burn out from repetition

**What they should do:**
- Group raid: 8 mins per clear
- 3 raids = 24 mins total
- Save 21 mins for other activities

**How to find groups:**
- Type "/lfg raid" in global chat
- Join Discord raid channels
- Add active players as friends

**Objection:** "I don't want to socialize"

**Answer:** You don't have to. Group raids require zero conversation. Just join, do damage, leave.

## Long-Term Yen Planning

### 30-Day Projection

**Daily Income:** 70K Yen
**Monthly Total:** 70K × 30 = 2,100K Yen

**Monthly Budget (Example):**

| Expense | Cost | Priority |
|---------|------|---------|
| S-tier Contracts (2-3) | 450K | Critical |
| Upgrades | 300K | High |
| Raid Supplies | 150K | Medium |
| Emergency Fund | 500K | High |
| Experimentation | 200K | Low |

### Yen Milestones

**Day 1:** 70K (first daily routine)
**Day 3:** 210K (can afford second S-tier with codes)
**Week 1:** 490K (solid build foundation)

**Week 2:** 980K (approaching 1M)
**Day 20:** 1,400K (can afford emergencies)
**Day 30:** 2,100K (endgame viable)

**At Day 30 with optimal farming, you can:**
- Own 3-4 S-tier contracts

- Have 500K emergency fund
- Never worry about Yen again

## FAQ

### "What if I can only play 1 hour per day?"

**Priority routine (1 hour):**
1. Daily Missions (30 mins) → 15K
2. Bat Raid x2 (30 mins) → 20K
**Total:** 35K Yen/day

**30-day projection:** 1,050K Yen

**Verdict:** Still viable. Takes twice as long, but works.

### "Is it worth paying for faster Yen?"

**NO.** Game is designed around F2P earning rates.

**Paying for Yen:**
- Costs real money
- Ruins sense of progression
- Creates unhealthy spending habits
- Still have skill gap to overcome

**Better investment:** Spend $0, invest time learning mechanics.

### "I fell behind everyone else. Can I catch up?"

**YES.** Yen advantage is temporary.

**Skill advantage is permanent:**
- Rich player with poor mechanics loses to skilled F2P
- Yen buys tools, not skill
- PvP is ultimately skill-based

**Catching up timeline:**
- Week 1: You'll be behind
- Week 2: Gap narrows
- Week 3: Nearly equal (1 S-tier vs their 2-3)
- Week 4: Equal footing (your skill might surpass theirs)

**Remember:** Whales quit. Skilled players stay.
